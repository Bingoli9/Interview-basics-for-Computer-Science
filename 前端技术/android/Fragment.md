## Fragment

Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities. You can think of a fragment as a modular section of an activity, which has its own lifecycle, receives its own input events, and which you can add or remove while the activity is running.

Fragment优势

- Modularity：不必把所有代码全部写在Activity中，而是把代码写在各自的Fragment中
- Reusability:多个Activity可以重用Fragment
- Adaptability: 可适配
