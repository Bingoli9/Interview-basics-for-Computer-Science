## Protocol downgrade attacks

A downgrade attack is a form of crytographic attack on a computer system or commuication protocol that makes it abandon a high-quality mode of operation (encryped connection) in favor of an older, lower-quality mode of operation that is typically provided for backward compatibility with older systems. 

An example of such a flaw was found in OpenSSL that allowde the attacker to negotiate the use of a lower version of TLS between the client and server.

Downgrader attacks are often implemented as part of a man-in-the-middle attack, and may be used as a way of enabling a cryptographic attack that might not be possible othetwise.
